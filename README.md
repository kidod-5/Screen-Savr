## Reflection 

This project served to solidify my confidence and understanding of fundamental react hooks, react contexts and use of an external api.  I also found the developement process using vite to be faster and more efficient then using create-react-app.  In the future I hope to add featuring allowing users to find local tickets to popular film and to add a section for saving films that have already been watched.
